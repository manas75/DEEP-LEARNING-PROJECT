## This project focuses on the design and implementation of a deep learning–based image classification system using TensorFlow and Keras. The objective of the project is to build a functional convolutional neural network (CNN) that can automatically learn visual features from images and accurately classify them into predefined categories. The project follows a complete deep learning workflow, making it suitable for internship submissions, academic evaluations, and beginner-to-intermediate deep learning portfolios.The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision research. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 color images of size 32×32 pixels belonging to 10 different classes, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, dogs, and ships. Using this dataset allows the project to demonstrate how deep learning models can generalize across multiple object categories while handling real-world variations in lighting, orientation, and background.
